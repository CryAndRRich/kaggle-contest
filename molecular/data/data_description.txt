PrimeState: A computed property related to the ground (or “prime”) electronic state of the molecule, often serving as a reference state for further excited state calculations

PrimeExcite(eV): The excitation energy (eV) for the transition from the ground state (PrimeState) to a designated excited state, as calculated by the Prime method

PrimeExcite(osc): The oscillator strength for the excitation from the PrimeState to an excited state, as determined by the Prime method

TDOS*: The Density of States (DOS) for the triplet manifold. Each peak is spread by a Gaussian function with a standard deviation of 0.2 eV, representing the distribution of triplet state energies

SDOS*: The Density of States for the singlet manifold. This DOS is weighted by the state’s oscillator strength and each peak is broadened by a Gaussian (σ = 0.2 eV). It effectively represents a predicted absorption spectrum that has been shifted (by approximately +1.1 eV) and rescaled
